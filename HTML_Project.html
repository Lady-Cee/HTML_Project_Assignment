            <dt><h3>About Abacha (African Salad)</h3></dt> <p></p>
            <dd>Abacha, also known as African Salad, is a highly nutritious and sumptuous delicacy native to the Igbos <br>
                in the South-Eastern part of Nigeria. It is usually served at Igbo traditional gatherings and can be enjoyed <br>
                as a snack, dessert, appetizer or full meal any day. It is often prepared with dried shredded cassava which <br>
                is usually soaked in water to soften it a bit. The dried shredded cassava is gotten from cassava tubers which <br>
                are sliced with a grater or knife into small pieces, boiled and sun-dried. <p></p>
                
                Abacha is usually prepared with ugba (oil bean) and garnished with chopped garden egg leaves, utazi, sliced onions, <br>
                and smoked fish, fried fish, kanda or stockfish. The assortment of green vegetables, ugba and various ingredients <br>
                make Abacha a balanced meal and recommended for healthy living. <p></p>
                
                Cassava is gluten-free, high in carbohydrates and calories due to the high sucrose content. It also is rich in B-complex <br>
                nutrients and has low levels of fats. The green vegetables are rich sources of minerals, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, <br>
                and calcium. It also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Garden egg leaves are great for cellular regeneration <br>
                and help to restore dead cells. Ugba is rich in protein as well as the fish and meat.  <p></p>
                
                Obviously, African salad has excellent dietary advantages. <p></p>

          <dd>  <p>The fresh Abacha (African salad is a by-product of cassava). There are a lot of processes involved with obtaining the fresh <br>
                abacha that is used in preparing the African salad that we all know. Most rural dwellers are very familiar with turning cassava <br>
                tubers into dried abacha that is used for this recipe. <p></p>
                
                The first thing to do (if you live in the village or own a farm) is to get cassava tubers. Wash thoroughly and boil along with water <br>
                for twenty to thirty minutes then pill to remove the brown outer layer, and cut to tiny bits, then soak the sliced cassava in water <br>
                for 18 hours. The last thing to do would be to wash thoroughly with clean water then sun-dry and store in an airtight container.<br>
                Dried cassava chips can last more than a year if stored in an air tight dry environment.
                <p></p>
                If you live in developed cities you probably wouldn’t need to go through this cumbersome process, just buy every ingredient <br>
                in the market.

<dl><h4>Steps/ method in preparing Abacha (African Salad)</h4>
<dd>
<p>I enjoy using the dried abacha instead of the freshly made wet abacha. The only reason is that the former gives <br>
    you the advantage of heating at the beginning for a few minutes without getting overly wet. <p></p>

    <ul>
<li>Heat or soak the dry Abacha in boiled water for about three minutes, then sieve and keep on a separate bowl.</li>
<li>Blend your crayfish and also slice the onions, garden egg leaves</li>
<li>Dissolve the powdered potash in about half a cup of clean water</li>
<li>Filter the dissolved potash into a mortar or pot, leaving out the residue</li>
<li>Add about 150ml (depending on the quantity of the Abacha) of palm oil and stir to form a yellowish paste (ncha, as addressed by the igbos)</li>
<li>Stir very well to get the yellowish paste. Then add the ground crayfish and pepper, stir, then add the ground ehu </li>
<li>Add the ugba to the mixture and stir, and then add the abacha, salt</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Stir the whole combination and you are almost through with the preparation part. <p></p>

        <b>The Toppings</b> <br>
        The garden eggs, the leaves, and the onions are used to spice up or for decoration and not added during preparation but while dishing out. <br>
        They are sliced and kept aside in different plates or bowls, then added while individual plates are dished out; 
        this also goes for the meat or fish used. <p></p>
        
        Serve with the meat and also add the garden eggs (sliced) and leaves to individual plate.
        
        </p>
    <p>It is advisable to heat the abacha (using the method outlined above) just a few seconds before you use so it doesn’t get cold.<br>
        Most people like their Abacha to be a little warm.</p>
